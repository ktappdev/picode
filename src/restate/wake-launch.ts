/** How the companion service revives a stopped picode when a deliverAfter
 *  envelope comes due. Kept SDK-free and pure so it's unit-testable without
 *  a restate-server.
 *
 *  The spawned `pi` must be told where its state lives: without
 *  `--picode-storage restate` it would boot against the local-fs backend and
 *  never see the picode it's supposed to revive. The service can't know the
 *  ingress URL its clients used, so it comes from the service's own
 *  environment:
 *
 *  - RESTATE_INGRESS_URL  — ingress the revived picode connects back to
 *                           (default http://localhost:8080)
 *  - PI_THREAD_EXTENSION  — path to this extension's entry point, passed as
 *                           `--extension`; omit if pi loads it from its own
 *                           config
 *  - PI_BIN               — pi executable to spawn (default "pi" from PATH).
 *                           Needed on Windows, where the npm-installed "pi"
 *                           is a .cmd shim spawn() can't execute — point it
 *                           at a real executable
